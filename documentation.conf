Groups the elements of the agentset or list based on the result of the reporter.
The results of the reporter become the keys in the table.
When grouping a list, each item of the list will be passed into the reporter as an argument and the values of table will be lists.
When grouping an agentset, the agents will run the reporter.

Example of running on a list:

```
observer> show table:group-by range 10 [ num -> num mod 3 ]
observer: {{table: [[0 [0 3 6 9]] [1 [1 4 7]] [2 [2 5 8]]]}}
```

Example of running on an agentset:

```
observer> create-turtles 100 [ set color one-of [ red green blue ] ]
observer> show table:group-by turtles [ color ]
observer: {{table: [[105 (agentset, 38 turtles)] [55 (agentset, 32 turtles)] [15 (agentset, 30 turtles)]]}}
